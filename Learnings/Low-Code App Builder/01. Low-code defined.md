# Low-code defined

## Low-code application development
  Drag & drop instead of Writing code, pre-built components, Faster collabration etc.

  #### Benefits:
  - App development tasks are streamlined  
  - App development simpler  
  - Increased productivity
  - Less IT involvement

### The value of low code
  - Better collabration between **business stakeholders** and **skilled developers**  
  - Team can **deliver value more rapidly** and **work with stakeholders effectively**

### Building with low code tools
  - **Robust app development:** Pega's low-code platform can be used to create very robust applications in a myriad of channels.
  - **Omnichannel capability:** “One build, many places.” E.g. Web page, a mobile application or a Tab
  - **Integraion:** Pega offers integration with other systems to obtain data

### Low code and developers
  - Both **citizen developer** and **Professional developer** can perform app development effectively.

## Integrating with external applications
  - **Data integraion:**
    - API: Pega API integration connector
    - Non-API application: Pega RPA(attended/unattended robots)
  
  - **Pega Manager**
    Pega Manager allows to 
      - Monitor robots
      - Schedule robots
      - provides peformance analytics

      - Designed for: Business architects, citizen developers, application developer, front-end developer, data engineers, business analyst, and system architect
   - **Dev Studio:**
      - Offering: A low-code workspace with advanced configuration options
      - Designed for: Technical team members, full-stack developers, system architects, database and security administrators
   - **Prediction Studio:** 
      - Offering: An analytics workspace which provides features to build machine-learning models for adaptive, predictive, and text analytics. 
      - Designed for: Data scientists and business decision-makers.
   - **Admin Studio:** 
      - Offering: A software administration workspace which provides runtime information and configuration options for monitoring and debugging system resources.
      - Designed for: IT staff for system administration.

### Studio navigation
  Each studio consists of three areas:
  - A header
  - A navigation pane
  - A workspace

---

## App Studio
 It provides core features for application development, such as 
   - Case design
   - Data management
   - User experience

### App Studio workspace
  App studio workspace outlines relationship between below components.
   - Stages of the process
   - Participating personas
   - communication channels
   - Data required for process resolution

### Support for agile development
  - Quickly build outline of the process
  - Real-time UI design as you process the work

### Application profile
  - The Application profile captures and presents following items to support agile development best practices.
    - User stories  
    - Bugs  
    - Feedback items  
  - This collection supports collaboration across technical and business members of the team

### Modular application design
  - Rules can be reused across multiple applications, which makes Pega development modular

### Application layers
  - Layers and the rules within them are reusable. 
  - Each layer represents a unique application and is built on one or more layers, except for the Pega Platform layer, which includes rules for the Pega Platform itself (PegaRULES).  
  - This modular approach to application design reduces development time and improves application quality and maintenance, even for complex applications. For example, each layer can be maintained by a dedicated development team and updated on its own schedule based on business needs.
