## Classes:
  Within an application, groups of rules is called **Class.**

  - **Parent class:** A class which contains other class(s) is called **parent class**
  - **Child class:** A class present in another class is called **child class**. It can inherit the rules created in parent class.

### Each application consists of three class types:
  - **Work class:**
    It contains the Rules that describe how to **process Cases, such as Processes, data elements, and user interfaces**.
    E.g: 
  - **Integration class:**
    It contains the Rules that describe how **the application interacts with other systems**, such as the integration assets that connect the application to an external customer database or a third-party web server.

  - **Data class:**
    It contains the Rules that describe **the data types in the application**, such as a customer data type or an order items data type
